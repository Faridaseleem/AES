# AES
implementation of AES python code
Overview
This project implements AES encryption and decryption using Python. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm used for securing sensitive information. This implementation focuses on the 128-bit key size.

Features
AES Encryption: Encrypts plaintext using a 16-character key.
AES Decryption: Decrypts ciphertext back to plaintext.
Key Expansion: Generates round keys from the provided encryption key.
Padding: Adds padding to plaintext to make it a multiple of 16 bytes.
ASCII and Hexadecimal Outputs: Displays ciphertext in both ASCII and hexadecimal formats.
